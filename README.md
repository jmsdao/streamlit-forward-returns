## Visit the Live App
[You can find it here.](https://jmsdao-streamlit-forward-returns-home-jjvs6e.streamlit.app/)

## Environment Setup
Install the environment with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```
conda env create -f conda_env.yml
```
(The conda YAML is intentionally not called `environment.yml` so Streamlit will use `requirements.txt` for deployment.)

## Run the app locally
From the root of this repo, activate the your environment then run:
```
streamlit run Home.py
```
